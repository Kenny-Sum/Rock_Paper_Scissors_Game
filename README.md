# Introduction
website link : https://kenny-sum.github.io/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game/

This website was created to allow users to play rock, paper and scissors against the computer. The rules are simple. The user choses between three handsigns (rock, paper or scissors) to use against the computer. The computer randomly chooses between the three as well (rock, paper or scissors) to use against the player. Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. A score of one is added to whoever wins the round.
If player and computer choses the same handsigns, it results in a draw and nothing is added to the score. The first to reach to a score of 5, wins the game.
